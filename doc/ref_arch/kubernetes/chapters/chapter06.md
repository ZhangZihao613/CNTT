The following are core principles to consider when securing cloud-native applications and infrastructure;

- Deploy only secure applications and trusted codes
- Only deploy applications from validated and verified images
- Only deploy applications from truested registries
- Containers orchestration (Kubernetes) must be secure with administrative boundaries between tenants
